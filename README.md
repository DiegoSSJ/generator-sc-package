# Sitecore packagene generator

This is the yeoman generator for sitecore packages to use with the NPM package sitecore-package-manager
Its main usage is to give a structure and a nuspec file for generating the nuget package correctly.

## usage
Since yeoman.io doesnt support scoped generators yet. you need to install it yourself.

```javascript
npm install -g yo @pentia/generator-sc-package 
yo @pentia/sc-package
```
